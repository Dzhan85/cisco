# Power over Ethernet (PoE)
Power can come from the following three sources:
1. An external AC adapter connected directly to the device:
  * The external AC adapter plugs into a normal AC wall outlet and provides 48V DC to the device. These adapters, commonly called wall warts , are handy if no other power source is available. However, if a power failure occurs in the room or outlet where the adapter is located, the powered device will fail.

2. A power injector, which connects to AC power near an Ethernet switch and provides DC power over the network data cable:
  *  PoE switch consumes a lot more power than a switch provides then we use PoE injector. Typically, a power injector is connected to AC power in a wiring closet close to the switch. One pitfall of using power injectors is that you need one injector and one AC power outlet per switch port!

3. A switch capable of providing DC Power over Ethernet (PoE) over the network data:
  * More elegant solution. Here, a 48V DC supply is provided to a device over the same unshielded twisted-pair cable that is used for Ethernet connectivity. The DC power source is the Catalyst switch itself. No other power source is needed unless an AC adapter is required as a redundant source.

## PoE Methods:
Cisco Inline Power (ILP): 7W
IEEE 802.3af (PoE): 15.4W
IEEE 802.3at (PoE+): 25.5W
Cisco Universal PoE (UPoE): 60W

### Configuration:
<pre>
Switch(config)#<b>interface gigabitethernet1/0/1</b>
Switch(config-if)#<b>power inline</b> {<b>auto</b> [<b>max</b> <i>milli-watts</i>] | <b>never</b> | <b>static</b> [<b>max</b> <i>milli-watts</i>]}
</pre>
* **auto** sets the interface to automatically detect and supply power to the powered device. This is the default configuration.
* **static** sets the interface to higher priority than auto.
  * If necessary, you can use the **max** keyword to specify the maximum wattage allowed on the interface (4000 to 15400 milliwatts).
* **never** to disable detection and power for the PoE capable interface.
