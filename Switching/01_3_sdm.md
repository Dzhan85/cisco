# Switching Database Manager (SDM) on Catalyst 3750 Series Switches
### VLAN Template:
* Disables IP routing
* Supports the maximum number of MAC addresses

### Routing Template
* Allows IP routing
* Supports fewer MAC addresses

### Access Template
* Supports the maximum number of ACLs
* Enables IP routing
* Supports slightly more MAC addresses than Routing Template

### DEfault Template
* AKA Desktop Default template
* Compromise among the VLAN, Routing, and Access templates

## Verificatio
<pre>
Switch#<b>show sdm prefer</b>s
 The current template is "desktop default" template.
 The selected template optimizes the resources in
 the switch to support this level of features for
 8 routed interfaces and 1024 VLANs.

  number of unicast mac addresses:                  6K
  number of IPv4 IGMP groups + multicast routes:    1K
  number of IPv4 unicast routes:                    8K
    number of directly-connected IPv4 hosts:        6K
    number of indirect IPv4 routes:                 2K
  number of IPv4 policy based routing aces:         0
  number of IPv4/MAC qos aces:                      0.5K
  number of IPv4/MAC security aces:                 1K

## Configuration
In this example you learn how to choose from the SDM options?
<pre>
Switch(config)#<b>sdm prefer dual-ipv4-and-ipv6 ?</b>
  default  Default bias
  routing  Unicast bias
  vlan     VLAN bias
</pre>
The answer is we can get help from `show sdm prefer`:

<pre>
Switch#<b>show sdm prefer dual-ipv4-and-ipv6 default</b>
