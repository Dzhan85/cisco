# Network Address Translation (NAT)

* 4 areas specific to NAT
  * Inside Local
    * Host IP address as it is known to the inside network
    * Most likely to be private address
  * Inside Global
    * Host IP address as assigned by your ISP
  * Outside Local
    * Same as Inside  Local but at the other end
  * Outside Global
    * Same as inside global for the outside  local
    
* NAT Implementation:
  * **Static NAT:** For servers in our private subnet but we want to be accessible from outside
  * **Dynamic NAT**
  * **Dynamic PAT (NAT Overloading)**
  * **Policy NAT:**
  
* Difference between `ip nat inside source` and `ip nat outside source`

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `ip nat inside source` | Translates the **source** of IP packets that are traveling **inside** to **outside** <br /> Translates the **destination** of the IP packets that are traveling **outside** to **inside** |
| `ip nat outside source` | Translates the **destination** of the IP packets that are traveling **inside** to **outside** <br /> Translates the **source** of the IP packets that are traveling **outside** to **inside** |

Remember that the traffic from outside is not allowed by default to come inside.
We have to make an ACL to allow the specific traffic to get in. If you `ping`
with the above configuration, it will fail. Hence you have to permit icmp reply:

### Dynamic NAT
<pre><b>

### Dynamic PAT (NAT Hide)
<pre><b>
