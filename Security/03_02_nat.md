# Network Address Translation (NAT)

* 4 areas specific to NAT
  * Inside Local
    * Host IP address as it is known to the inside network
    * Most likely to be private address
  * Inside Global
    * Host IP address as assigned by your ISP
  * Outside Local
    * Same as Inside  Local but at the other end
  * Outside Global
    * Same as inside global for the outside  local
    
* NAT Implementation:
  * **Static NAT:** For servers in our private subnet but we want to be accessible from outside
  * **Dynamic NAT**
  * **Dynamic PAT (NAT Overloading)**
  * **Policy NAT:** Using ACL
  
* Difference between `ip nat inside source` and `ip nat outside source`
