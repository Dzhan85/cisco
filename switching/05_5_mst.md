# Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) - IEEE 802.1s standard
By default Cisco Catalyst Switches run PVST+ or Rapid PVST+
(Per VLAN Spanning Tree). This means that each VLAN is mapped to a
single spanning tree instance. When you have 200 VLANs, it means there
are 200 instances of spanning tree. This requires a lot of CPU power
and memory.

## PVST+ vs MST
* PVST+:
    * One instance per VLAN
        * 1 VLAN = 1 Instance
        * 200 VLAN = 200 Instances
    * Can't change VLAN-to-instance relationship
    * A default instance for VLAN 1 always exists
* MST:
    * VLANs can be arbitrarily mapped to instances
        * VLANs 1, 5, 7 = 1 instance
        * VLANs 2, 20, 200 = 1 instance
    * You define VLAN-to-instance mappings
    * MST0 is the default instance for all VLANs (1-4094)
        * MST0 is also called the Internal Spanning Tree (IST)

MST works with the concept of regions. Switches that are configured to
use MST need to find out if their neighbors are running MST.

When switches have the same attributes they will be in the same region.
Itâ€™s possible to have one or more regions and here are the attributes
that need to match. (YOU explicitly configure these attributes):
* MST configuration name.
* MST configuration revision number.
* MST instance-to-VLAN mapping table.

### Example: These are in the different regions

### Example: These are in the same region:

So, here both switches can run MST with each other.
