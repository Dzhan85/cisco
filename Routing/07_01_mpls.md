# Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
* Routers usually make decisions based on destination IP addresses with exception of PBR.
* MPLS is a new paradigm in the way routers make forwarding decisions.
* With MPLS the routers no loner look at the destination IP address to make decisions.
They are looking at MPLS label to determine what to do.
* Multiprotocol Label Switching
  * Multiprotocol: MPLS is capable of transporting many L2 and L3 protocols.
  It sits between layer 2 and layer 3 header.
    * MPLS header is 32 bits: (20-bit label value, 3-bit traffic class field, 1-bit bottom of stack flag, 8-bit TTL field)
  * Labels (20 bits): Ultimately determine the destiny of a packet through an MPLS network.
  * Label switching: packets are switched based on labels not IP addresses.
* Why MPLS?
  * Unified network infrastructure
  * Scalable and secure L3VPNs using a peer-to-peer model. Secure because all the customer
  routing information is completely separated from other customers because it is peer-to-peer model.
  * BGP-free core: Only Provider Edge routers need to know about the customer's IP, all other
  core routers make decisions base on labels.
  * Traffic engineering capabilities (MPLS TE): MPLS fast reroute, bandwidth management, ...
  * WAN QoS requirements.
  * MPLS VPN Applications:
    * Setup point-to-point E1 leased line over MPLS VPN
    * Private LAN Service

### MPLS Terminology
* Label Switched Routers (LSR): A router that running MPLS
  * LSR can be an:
    * ingress edge LSR: receives the regular IP packet the it pushes one or more labels
    onto the MPLS stack and forward the packet into the MPLS network
    * intermediate LSR: purely label switching. receives the labeled packet and performs some
    operations (push, pop, or swap)
    * egress edge LSR: the exiting end of the MPLS network. The opposite of ingress edge LSR 
  * Operations:
    * push operation: adding a label od a stack of labels
    * pop operation: removing a label
    * swap operation:swapping a label value to another label
* Label Switched Path: end to end path (tunnels)
* Forwarding Equivalency Class (FEC): group of packets that are **forwarded the same way**
through the MPLS network.
  * Same labels
  * Same treatment
  * FEC can theoretically be based on many different things: L3 destination prefix, QoS, L2 PVC, BGP next-hop, TE tunnel, link color, etc...
* Label Distribution Protocol (LDP): enables LSRs to exchange label binding information
for supporting hop-by-hop forwarding. Before LDP became popular you might hear about TDP
which was Cisco proprietary protocol for exchanging labels.

### MPLS Data Plane
* LSR uses the *FIB* to forward *unlabeled IP packets*
* LSR uses *LFIB* to forward *labeled packets*
* The FIB and LFIB databases are build by various control plane protocols

| | IP Forwarding | MPLS Forwarding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control Plane Databases | RIB `show ip route` | LIB |
| Data Plane Forwarding | FIB `show ip cef` | LFIB `show mpls forwarding-table` | 

### MPLS Control Plane
* Step 1: Every LSR generates unique local label for every connected, static, and IGP prefix.
* Step 2: Exchange prefix/label bindings with all LDP neighbors.
  * Each LSR labels the packet it received then it tells the sender LSR about the label
  which it put on the packet.
* Once labels are exchanged, the MPLS data plane (LFIB) can be constructed.
* Only the best prefix/label biding from the LIB get put into the LFIB.
* The best path is still chosen by the IGP.
* LDP hello messages list LDP RID (unlike OSPF it must be a valid IP address)] are
multicast to 224.0.0.2 UDP 646 (The All Routers multicast group
addresses all routers on the same network segment) to discover LDP neighbors.
* Once the neighbors are discovered, TCP 646 session is opened between LDP routers to do label
exchange. TCP session is between LDP RIDs. This is why they must be routable.
* Highest LDP RID initiates TCP session.
* Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP):
  * LSR advertises a special label called *implicit null* (label value 3) for any prefixes that
  it needs to forward packets for using IP only (outside MPLS).
  * The *implicit null* label tells the upstream neighbor to pop the outer most label before
  sending the packet as an efficiency mechanism.
