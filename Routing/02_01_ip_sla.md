# Cisco IOS IP Service-Level Agreement (IP SLA)
* IP SLA (Measurement-Based Routing) is a contract between customers and
service providers. It is a feature on Cisco IOS to measure the network
performance. Here we don't take care about the written contract. IP SLA
can be combined with other IOS features, such as static route
and policy-based routing. 

* In the routing world we might decide to do a measurement based rather than
failure-based kind of detection. Almost everything dealing with SLA is taking
the measurement and making an intelligent routing decision based on that. 

* The measurement can be as simple as using the equivalent of a ping to
determine whether an IP address responds, or as sophisticated as measuring the
jitter (delay variation) of VoIP packets that flow over a particular path.


* A wide range of IP SLA exists. The following list summarizes the majority of
the available operation types: 
  * ICMP (echo, jitter)
  * RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) (VoIP) 
  * TCP connection (establish TCP connections) 
  * UDP (echo, jitter) 
  * DNS 
  * DHCP 
  * HTTP 
  * FTP 

* When we use IP SLA for some protocols like ping, we need to configure SLA
only on source but for more complicated protocols like RTP we need to
configure *respond* (SLA Responder) on destination as well. 

### Scenario:

![ip_sla](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31813625/35179024-dc296a80-fd5f-11e7-87c1-e3a2fa54018d.png)
 
Base configuration

R1:
<pre>
hostname R1
!
no ip icmp rate-limit unreachable
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip address 10.1.12.1 255.255.255.252
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip address 10.1.14.1 255.255.255.248
!
ip route 10.1.234.0 255.255.255.248 10.1.12.2
ip route 10.1.234.0 255.255.255.248 10.1.14.4 5
!
</pre>
R2:
<pre>
hostname R2
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 10.1.234.2 255.255.255.248
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip address 10.1.12.2 255.255.255.252
</pre>
R3:
<pre>
hostname R3
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 10.1.234.3 255.255.255.248
!
ip route 10.1.12.0 255.255.255.252 10.1.234.2
ip route 10.1.14.0 255.255.255.248 10.1.234.4
</pre>
R4:
<pre>
hostname R4
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 10.1.234.4 255.255.255.248
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip address 10.1.14.4 255.255.255.248
</pre>

In this scenario the reachability is provided by static routes.
Currently R1 selects R2 to reach loopback 10.1.3.1 because of having better distance (=1).
Whenever one of the connection between R2 and SW or R4 and SW fails, itâ€™ll fail over to another.
The potential issue is that default route could be still in routing table
but with no connection from ISP routers toward the server. To prevent
this situation we can combine Static route with IP SLA.

SLA Solution: R1 is now using IP SLA to ping the server. As long as we get a reply,
we will keep using R2 as our main route. When the ping fails, we switch over to R4.
This method is more reliable as we check end-to-end connectivity. 

#### IP SLA Configuration: 
<pre>
R1(config)#<b>track 1 ip sla 11</b> #we have to combine object tracking with IP SLA. Then whenever the ICMP doesn't work, the static route will be deleted from the routing table. Old IOS ip sla --> rtr 
R1(config-track)#<b>exit</b>
R1(config)#<b>ip sla 11</b> #Creates the IP SLA operation following with SLA Operation Number. In some IOS we need to use ip sla monitor 11 instead. In this case the following commands would varies. Try question mark (?) 
R1(config-ip-sla)#<b>icmp-echo 10.1.234.3 source-ip 10.1.12.1</b>
R1(config-ip-sla-echo)#<b>frequency 5</b> #sends icmp packets every 5 seconds 
R1(config-ip-sla-echo)#<b>exit</b> 
R1(config)#<b>ip sla schedule 11 start-time now life forever</b> #starts our IP SLA operation immediately and run it forever 
R1(config)#<b>ip route 10.1.234.0 255.255.255.248 10.1.12.2 track 1</b> #We want to combine the static route with the IP SLA. This rout is the main route 
</pre>

<pre>
R2(config)#<b>interface gigabitEthernet 0/0</b>
R2(config-if)#<b>shutdown</b>
<b>R1</b># <b>traceroute 10.1.234.3</b>
