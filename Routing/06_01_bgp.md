# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
* Version 4
* The main function of BGP is to provide *path vector* routing between different
*autonomous systems* (eBGP)
  * Similar to distance vector because for each prefix we learn about,
  we learn how far away it is (distance). and which way we go to get there (vector).
  * Different than the distance vector because for each prefix we have a record of
  the entire **AS path**. And also, there is no one clear "metric" in BGP. On BGP we rely
  on different BGP path attributes that ultimately lead into the selection of the best path.
    * BGP uses AS Path for 2 key jobs:
      1. Select the path (shortest AS path)
      2. Preventing routing loops
* eBGP tells the routers how to get between various AS's.
Once the packet gets to the AS, BGP's job is done and further routing is handled internal to the AS.
* Interior BGP (iBGP)
  * Helps propagate eBGP learned routes between edge routers.
  * Typical in multi-homing scenarios.
* BGP is a TCP application operation on port 179.
  * Important when trying  to run BGP through firewalls.
  * Neighborship forms even to non-directly connected routers. So, the neighbors
  can be in different subnets.
* Network Layer Reachablity Information (NLRI) which is unique to BGP version 4
means length and prefix For example:
    * /25 (the length), 204.149.16.128 (prefix)
    * /23, 206.134.32
    * /8, 10

#### BGP vs IGPs
Similarities:
* BGP does advertise subnets
* BGP does establish a neighbor relationship
* 3 tables like OSPF and EIGRP
  * neighborship table: `show ip bgp summary`
  * topology table: `show ip bgp`
  * routing table: `show ip route bgp`

Differences
* BGP does not require neighbors to be attached to the same subnet.
* Metric in IGPs vs Path attributes in BGP
* Fast convergence in IGPs vs scalability in BGP
* Advertising prefix/length in IGPs vs NLRI in BGP

#### eBGP vs iBGP
eBGP
  * Peering between different AS's
  * Administrative distance of 20
  * When advertising, a BGP router updates the AS_PATH PA
  * Next-hop changes!
  * TTL=1: because usually two ASs are directly connected

iBGP
  * Peering between routers in same AS
  * Administrative Distance of 200
  * When advertising, a BGP router does not update the AS_PATH PA
  * Next-hop does not change by default. There are 2 solutions which we will discuss later
  * iBGP learned route can not be sent to an iBGP neighbor
    * So, iBGP requires a full mesh peering (old school way)
  * In iBGP TTL is not limited to 1, because its probable that we have many hops in between.  

    
### Why BGP?
* Service Provider perspective:
  * Scalable
  * Private routing between AS's
  * Manage connections to MPLS networks. MPLS VPN doesn't allow us to run IGPs between 
  our branches. We have two solutions running a tunnel or using BGP as a private use.
  In this case we use AS 64512 to 65534.
* Customer perspective
  * Get block of public IP independent from the service provider
  * When 2 companies want to merge, instead of directly route redistribution,
  BGP makes it a very good translation in between two companies with different
  routing protocols.
  * Design scenarios:
    * Single-homes: We have 1 ISP and 1 link to the ISP, the only reason is to get block of IP
    independent from the service provider
    * Dual-homed: We have 1 ISP and more than one link to the ISP
    ![dual-homed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31813625/35188306-e91ad660-fe00-11e7-93c4-8e7cceeaf0cc.png)
    * Single-multihomed: We have more than 1 ISP, but one link per ISP
    ![signle-multihomed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31813625/35188405-f29e9a9e-fe02-11e7-8594-4e22581e0895.png)
    * Dual-multihomed: We have more than 1 ISP and more than one link per ISP

ISPs give you three basic options for what routes the ISP advertises:
* Full update: usually between service providers
* Default route only: When we only want to take advantage of ISP-independent IP address block. 
* Partial updates + default route: when we want to do PBR

### Injecting route into BGP
We can inject routes using `network` command, *redistribution*, *summarization*, or *default origination*.

#### Using `network` command
  * In IGPs when we use `network` command, we enabled that routing protocol on the matching
  interfaces with the network command. But in BGP when we use `network` command, the
  router looks in its routing table and if the equivalent prefix/length exists, puts that
  into the local BGP table.
    
  For example you have the following routes in your routing table
  ```
  C 10.10.10.0/24
  S 10.10.11.0/30
  D 10.10.12.0/28
  ```
  Then you issue `network 10.10.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0` command. Here nothing will be advertised
  since we don't have 10.10.0.0/16 network.
    
  * Solution?
    1. Add this static route `S 10.10.0.0/16 Null0`. This is better than the second and third method below.
    2. In the example above we can teach the router to learn 10.10.0.0/16 from EIGRP summarization.
    3. use of `auto-summary` advertises the subordinate routes (default is `no auto-summary`). Don't use this option. Just learn as a concept.
#### Using `redistribute` command

Configuration:
Suppose 11.11.0.0/16 is IP address block for AS 64500.

Here, I redistribute 11.11.0.0 (null 0) the BGP 64500
<pre>
R1(config)#<b>ip route 11.11.0.0 255.255.0.0 null 0</b>
R1(config)#<b>router bgp 64500</b>
R1(config-router)#<b>redistribute static route-map RDtoBGP</b>
R1(config)#<b>route-map RDtoBGP permit</b>    
R1(config-route-map)#<b>match ip address STATIC</b>
R1(config-route-map)#<b>description Because I may have multiple static routes in routing table of R1, I only select 11.11.0.0 to null0 route.</b>
% Description too long. Truncated to 100 characters.</b>
R1(config)#<b>ip access-list standard STATIC</b>
R1(config-std-nacl)#<b>permit 11.11.0.0 0.0.255.255</b>
R1(config-std-nacl)#<b>exit</b>
</pre>
Let's verify on R2
<pre>
R2#<b>show ip route bgp</b>
      11.0.0.0/16 is subnetted, 1 subnets
B        11.11.0.0 [<b>20</b>/0] via 1.1.1.1, 00:00:31
</pre>
Let's advertise 23.23.23.0 into BGP on R2. Here I choose the `network` command
<pre>
R2(config)#<b>router bgp 64510</b>
R2(config-router)#<b>network 23.23.23.0 mask 255.255.255.0</b>
</pre>
<pre>
R1#<b>show ip route bgp</b>
      23.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
B        23.23.23.0 [<b>20</b>/0] via 2.2.2.2, 00:00:29
</pre>
Then, I configured R3 and R4 using `network` command which I don't repeat here.

#### Using summarization
BGP don't use metric to find best path. It uses Path Attributes (PA).
By default, the shortest AS_PATH PA is the best path. AS_PATH PA consists of up to 4
components:
* AS_SEQ: The most commonly used
* AS_SET:
* AS_CONFED_SEQ
* AS_CONFED_SET

The `aggregate-address` command can create a summary route.
If we summarize addresses with
* the same AS_SEQ, the summary address will have the same AS_SEQ
* different AS_SEQs, then the summary AS_SEQ will be `Null0`
  * This can lead to loop. Solution is AS_SET. AS_SET gets all subnet's ASNs and holds
  an unordered list of them.
   
#### Adding default routes to BGP
* By injecting the default route using `network` command
* By injecting the default route using `redistribute` command
  * additional command `default-information originate` is then needed 
* By injecting the default route using `neighbor id default-information [route-map name]` command

### Internal BGP Configuration
Let's see why iBGP is needed in this scenario.
As we can see below, R4 doesn't have any route to reach 11.11.0.0/16 on AS 64500
<pre>
R4#<b>show ip route bgp</b>
      23.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
B        23.23.23.0 [20/0] via 3.3.3.3, 00:05:09
</pre>
Let's see why iBGP is needed generally:
* Service Provider: to become a transit AS
* Customer perspective: to allow routers in the same AS to reach the same conclusion
about the better through which to send packets for each Internet destination.


**Next-hop reachability issue**
iBGP doesn't change next-hop address. When R2 learns about `11.11.0.0/24` from R1, it knows
that the next-hop to reach `11.11.0.0/24` is R1. When in iBGP R2 wants to advertise the network
to R3, it doesn't update the next-hop to itself (R2) it teachs the R3 about `11.11.0.0/24`
but with the R1's address as the next-hop which R3 doesn't know how to reach to.
So there are 2 solutions:
1. Let R3 know how to reach R1
2. Better solution is to tell the iBGP to update the next-hop for R3 using
`R2(config-router)#neighbor 3.3.3.3 next-hop-self`

Now, let's go for configuration
<pre>
R2(config)#<b>router ospf 1</b>
R2(config-router)#<b>network 23.23.23.2 0.0.0.0 area 0</b>
R2(config-router)#<b>network 2.2.2.2 0.0.0.0 area 0</b>  
R2(config)#<b>router bgp 64510</b>
R2(config-router)#<b>neighbor 3.3.3.3 remote-as 64510</b>
R2(config-router)#<b>neighbor 3.3.3.3 update-source loopback 0</b>
R2(config-router)#<b>neighbor 3.3.3.3 next-hop-self</b>

</pre>
<pre>
R3(config-router)#<b>network 23.23.23.3 0.0.0.0 area 0</b>
R3(config-router)#<b>network 3.3.3.3 0.0.0.0 area 0</b>
R3(config-router)#<b>do pi 2.2.2.2 source 3.3.3.3</b>

!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 3/4/7 ms
R3(config-router)#<b>router bgp 64510</b>

#### Note:
* In this example we had 2 routers in iBGP.
* When a router learns routes from an iBGP peer, that router does not advertise the same
routes to another iBGP peer (to prevent loop). 
Imagine we have a router in between of our iBGP peers and our iBGP peers are not
physically connected together. In this case, we have to run iBGP full mesh for all
routers in between.

Let's see below example:

![ibgploop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31813625/35190866-442fcb8a-fe3a-11e7-8dc4-fede59bb2711.png)

Imagine that best route to reach 8.8.8.8 is from E2. A packet receives to Core1 having
default route it gives the packet to E1. E1 and E2 already decided that the best route
is E2, then if there is no physical link between E1 and E2, E1 gives the packet to Core1
to give it to E2. Then Core2 according the default route gives the packet to E2 again.
And this loop keeps going on until the TTL expires. We have some solutions:
1. Redistribute the eBGP to our IGP which is not efficient at all.
2. Bringing Core1 and Core2 in iBGP play then run a full mesh iBGP between them. (Full mesh)
  * Full mesh iBGP does not scale well
3. Route Reflectors: Route reflectors can receive routes from an iBGP neighbor and *reflect* those routes
to other iBGP neighbors
  * Route Reflector non-clients still are in full mesh
4. Confederations
  * To divide your AS into several smaller sub-autonomous systems
  * Normal rules apply to sub-autonomous systems (full mesh and route reflectors)
  * Sub-as peer with each other using confederation eBGP
