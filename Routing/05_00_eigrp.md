# Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
* EIGRP is an enhanced distance vector protocol.
* Does not keep link state information about every router.
* Instead each router shares its own routes with adjacent neighbors (directly connected).
* In RIP we only have one table which is the *routing table*.
In OSPF we have 3 tables. *routing table*, *neighbor's table*, *topology or database table*.
In EIGRP we are also having these 3 tables but different terminology and information.
* IP protocol 88
* EIGRP group address: 224.0.0.10
* EIGRP uses *Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP)* to ensure packets are sent in-order.
* EIGRP Route Types:
  * Internal: Originate from within EIGRP AS. Administrative distance 90.
  * External: Redistributed into the EIGRP AS. Administrative Distance 170.

### The diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)
* The goal is to find the shortest path to a destination without loop
* In OSPF, all routers know about every link state in the routing domain which easily avoids routing loops
* But in EIGRP loop is prevented by concept of
  * Feasible Distance (FD): distance from router to the destination with lowest metric
  * Reported Distance (RD): each router reports its own distance to the destination
  * Successor (S): The path which will put into the routing table
  * Feasible Successor (FS): if Feasible Condition met (see next line), then FS would be the backup path
  * Feasible Condition: RD<sub>FS</sub> < FD<sub>S</sub>
* The purpose of having a feasible successor:
  * Provides a pre-computed, loop-free path to the destination prefix if the successor route goes down
  * There can be multiple feasible successors

### EIGRP Packet Types:
* **Hello**
  * To discover EIGRP neighbors
    * Most networks: unreliably multicast every 5 seconds
    * NBMA networks: Unicast every 60 seconds
  * Every hello packet includes a hold-time which tells the **receiving neighbor** how often to expect hello messages
    * Defaults to 3x the Hello interval
    * So, hello interval is locally significant, but hold-time is significant for the neighbor
    * `passive-interface` prevents eigrp sending hello on that interface; however, EIGRP still advertises the subnets belonging to that interface.
      * Used for stub networks
* **Update**
  * Conveys routing prefix and metric information
  * Non-periodic: Not sent at defined intervals
  * Partial Update: Only changed routing information is sent
  * Bounded: Only routers that need routing updates receive them
* **Acknowledgment**
  * Really just unicast hello packets
  * Used to confirm receipt of a reliably transmitted packet
* **Query**
  * If there is no FS, the router which encountered a failed route:
    * sets the failed route to an *active* state
    * it sets the feasible distance to *infinity*
    * it sends a query (with cost of *infinity*) message over its links
    * When a query is sent to a neighbor, that neigbor has 3 minutes to reply (*Active Timer*)
 * **Reply**
  * Then is the neighbor has a route to the destination, it sends a *reply* to the router which sent a *query* message
    * *reply* contains the cost of itself to the destination which in the query was asked for
    * Then the router which sent the query insalls the router which sent the reply as its new successor
    * Finally Both routers send *update* packet to their neighbors telling about the new distance to the destination
      * And the router which lost the rout, now consider the path to the destination as a *passive* state
        * A route is in the *passive* state once the DUAL algorithm has converged on a final cost

### EIGRP Wighted Metric Formula
* K1, K2: related to Bandwidth
* K3: related to Delay
* K4, K5: related to Reliability
* Default values K1 and K3 are set to 1, all others are set to 0
* By default the EIGRP metric would be <pre>256 (10<sup>7</sup>/Bandwidth in Kibps + Delay in microseconds/10)</pre>

### Traditional EIGRP and Named EIGRP Configurations Compared

#### Basic configuration comparison
##### Traditional Approach
<pre>
R1(config)#<b>router eigrp 1</b>
R1(config-router)#<b>network 0.0.0.0</b></pre>

##### Named Approach
<pre>
R1(config)#<b>router eigrp R1</b>
R1(config-router)#<b>address-family ipv4 autonomous-system 1</b>
R1(config-router-af)#<b>network 0.0.0.0</b></pre>

* **The Named EIGRP Hierarchical Structure**
* Traditional and Named Approaches are compatible
* 3 different modes
  * **Address-Family:** General EIGRP configuration commands are issued under this
configuration mode. For example, router ID, network, and EIGRP
stub router configurations are performed here. Multiple address
families (for example, IPv4 and IPv6) can be configured under the
same EIGRP virtual instance.
  * **Address-Family-Interface:**
  Commands entered under interface configuration mode with
a traditional EIGRP configuration are entered here for Named
EIGRP configuration. For example, timer and passive interface
configurations are performed here.
  * **Address-Family-Topology:** Commands that have a direct impact on a routerâ€™s EIGRP topology
table are given in this configuration mode. For example, variance and
redistribution are configured in this mode.

* Example: advanced EIGRP Configuration Using the Named Configuration Approach
