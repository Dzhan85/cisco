# OSPFv3
* OSPFv2 does have one major limitation in that it does not support the routing of IPv6 networks
* IPv4 and IPv6 link-state routing protocol that supports IPv6 and IPv4 unicast address families (AFs)
* RFC 5340: OSPF for IPv6
* OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 Similarities:
  * RID is in IPv4 format
  * Virtual links are created using the RID
  * Timers, network types, and neighbors states
  * Unicast routing must be enabled
* OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 comparison
  * No network command or wildcard mask
  * In OSPFv3, a routing process does not need to be explicitly created. Enabling OSPFv3 on an interface will cause a routing process
  * Unlike OSPF version 2, multiple instances of OSPFv3 can be run on a link.
  * Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs do not carry prefix information
  * The Type 3 LSA is renamed as *Interarea prefix LSA for ABRs*
  * The Type 4 LSA is renamed *Interarea prefix LSA for ASBRs*
  * Two new LSA types:
    * Type 8 (Link LSAs): only exist on a local link. Advertises IPv6 **link-local** addresses, not their global unicast addresses
    * Type 9 (Intra-Area Prefix LSAs):
      * similar to the Type 1 LSA for IPv4 networks: It can send information about
IPv6 networks (including stub networks) attached to a router
      * similar to the Type 2 LSA for IPv4 networks: It can send information
about transit IPv6 network segments within an area
  * OSPFv3 Multicast Addresses:
    * FF02::5 --> All OSPF routers
    * FF02::6 --> All designated routers
  * OSPFv3 does not provide authentication instead it uses IPsec

## Configuration
* No `network` command
* No wildcard mask
* Enable interface configuration mode
