# Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
* GRE tunnels allow us to tunnel one protocol with another
  * The protocol being tunneled is the *passenger protocol*
  * The protocol tunneling the passenger is the *transport protocol*
* Defined in RFC 2784
* Encapsulates IPv4 or IPv6 packet inside an IPv4 packet
* Uses IP protocol 47
* Uses a 4-byte header
* We will have 20-byte Transport IP + 4-byte GRE + 20-byte Passenger IP (LAN) + Payload
* Show up in the IP routing table as a connected network
* Can be configured like a normal physical interface
* In configuration take this in mind that you must NEVER learn the destination of
the tunnel through the tunnel.
  * `%TUN-5-RECURDOWN: Tunnel0 temporarily disabled due to recursive routing`

### Common GRE use cases

* Tunneling private IP traffic over a public IP network
  * GRE over IPsec is very commonly used for lan-to-lan VPN tunnels
  * Tunnel encrypted private traffic through the public internet
* Now the question is why don't use IPsec by itself?  
  * Because IPsec can only protect unicast packets but GRE can encapsulate multicast traffic
* Carrying a protocol not routed in your environment over IP network
  * Tunneling IPv6 over IPv4 networks
  * Tunneling IPX, Appletalk, NetBIOS, whatever through your IP network
* Joining two similar network together that are separated by a dissimilar network
  * Disjointed OSPF areas or IGP domains
  * Allows you easily run a routing protocol between two routers that are not physically connected
